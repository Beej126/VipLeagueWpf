just two easy ONE TIME install steps
1. download and install the [Microsoft WebView2 "Evergreen"](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703) bits - this is an automatically updated version of msfts latest embedded web control based on MS Edge Chromium
1. then launch the [ClickOnce Installer](https://beejstor.z5.web.core.windows.net/VipLeagueWpf.application) for the application itself - ClickOnce manages prompting for and downloading updates to the app when they're published
