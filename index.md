[![.NET 5 CI](https://github.com/Beej126/VipLeagueWpf/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Beej126/VipLeagueWpf/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Two easy ONE TIME install steps:

1. [Microsoft WebView2 "Evergreen"](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=2124703) - automatically updated package of Microsoft's Edge Chromium based embedded web control.

1. [ClickOnce Installer](https://beejstor.z5.web.core.windows.net/VipLeagueWpf.application) for the application itself - ClickOnce handles automatic updates.
   - once the install completes, you'll find a "VipLeagueWpf" icon in your Start menu and you can pin it where you like from there.
